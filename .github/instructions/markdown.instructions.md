# Markdown Standards

- Use `##` for H2, `###` for H3 — avoid H4+ when possible
- Use `-` for bullets, `1.` for numbered lists, 2-space indent for nesting
- Use fenced code blocks with language specifier for syntax highlighting
- Use descriptive link text: `[link text](URL)`
- Include alt text for images: `![alt text](image URL)`
- Keep lines under 120 characters; use blank lines between sections
